# Multiplexer Cycling for Liquid Level Sensing

Using a mutliplexer reduces the number of pins necessary from the microcontroller saving us pins for alternative functionalities.

The parts used for this system include:

1. Texas Instruments [SN74HC151N](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74HC151/part-details/SN74HC151N) 8-Line To 1-Line Data Selector/Multiplexer,

2. Texas Instruments [MSP430FR2476](https://www.ti.com/product/MSP430FR2476/part-details/MSP430FR2476TRHAR) Mixed-Signal Microcontroller

3. [Liquid Level Sensor](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Littelfuse/59630-1-T-05-A?qs=sGAEpiMZZMs29kr3d%252BndI%252Bz%252B5qY7%2FswXh13rrbQA2SA%3D) Float Switch (x8)[^1]
