# Multiplexer Cycling for Liquid Level Sensing

This system was used within a self-sustainging hydroponic greenhouse to ensure liquid levels in many different reservoirs were not low. Using a mutliplexer reduces the number of pins necessary from the microcontroller saving us pins for alternative functionalities.

The parts used for this system include:

Texas Instruments SN74HC151N 8-Line To 1-Line Data Selector/Multiplexer,

Texas Instruments MSP430FR2476 Mixed-Signal Microcontroller

Liquid Level Sensor Float Switch (x8)
