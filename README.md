# Embedded-Systems

This repository contains hardware and software components of different systems.

Texas Instruments [MSP430](https://www.ti.com/microcontrollers-mcus-processors/microcontrollers/msp430-microcontrollers/overview.html?keyMatch=MSP430) family of microcontrollers were used alongside [Code Composer Studios](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO?keyMatch=CCS).

Design Considerations:
- Self Sustaining Greenhouse
  - [Multiplexer Cycling](https://github.com/KalebOTB/Embedded-Systems/tree/main/Multiplexer_Cycling)
  - [WiFi Module Serial Communication](https://github.com/KalebOTB/Embedded-Systems/tree/main/WiFi_Module_Serial_Communication)
  - Work in progress...
